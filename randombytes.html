<h3>A Random Bytes Generator <a onClick="switchMenu('randbytes');"

<div id="randbytes">
<p>
Once upon a time, I worked on a project in which files with random contents
and ranging sizes (from 1KB to a few GB) were needed, for testing purposes.
</p>

<p>
As a not-so-surprising next step, I used the Unix/Linux tool <b>dd</b> to create
such files from the entropy source <b>/dev/urandom</b>. It worked fine for the
first time. However, when the need came up again, I did find it a little 
cumbersome to occupy the limited disk space with these "junk" (or not) files, 
and to move them around when switching between machines. This is the motivation
of the following "random bytes generator", which generates a file, on the fly,
of a fixed size (in bytes) specified by the user and filled with random bytes,
for download.
</p>

<p>
To generate your random file, put this Perl CGI on your server:  
<a href="cgi-bin/randfile.cgi.txt" 
onclick="window.open(this.href); return false;" title="Generate random file">
randfile.cgi.txt</a>.
</p>

<p>
<i>Disclaimer</i>: The files generated by this application should NOT be used
where "strong randomness" is desired, and therefore in general are not suitable
for mission-critical and/or cryptographic applications.

Released by Phil Zimmermann in 1991, Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) is a computer 
program that supports encryption and digital signing of files. PGP is used 
by many to secure e-mail communications. PGP is free for personal use, but 
not open source software. In this guide, we will walk you walk you through
the basic, and thus perhaps most important, use cases of an open source 
alternative to PGP, GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG, or gpg).

<h3>A Sudoku puzzle solver in Bash
<a onClick="switchMenu('sudobash');"

<div id="sudobash">
<p>
Just a few days ago I came across an interesting blog column introducing a
<a href="http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2010/01/sudoku_puzzle_solver_using_awk.html" 
onclick="window.open(this.href); return false;" title="Sudoku puzzle solver 
using awk">Sudoku puzzle solver using awk</a>. It reminded me of a Sudoku 
solver that I wrote a few years ago, out of boredom, in Bash (Bourne-again 
shell). It uses utilities like `echo', `grep', and `sed', and it runs
really slow. I know you can easily do that in a language such as Perl. But 
who cares if one just wants to kill some time and have some fun?
</p>
<p>
You can find the script here: <a href="cgi-bin/sudobash">Sudoku solver in
bash</a>. To use it, put all 81 numbers in the puzzle, from the top row to the
bottom with empty cells replaced by zeros, into the first line of a text file,
say '<a href="cgi-bin/sample_puzzle.txt">sample_puzzle.txt<a/>', and from 
shell prompt, try
<br />
$ ./sudobash sample_puzzle.txt
</p>

<p>
Example:
<br />
$ echo "000381000123000600500007030204006080006000200090100306030800005005003427000045000" > sample_puzzle.txt
<br />
$ ./sudobash sample_puzzle.txt

 When working with a remote git repository which is hosted on a
 third-party storage server, data confidentiality sometimes becomes 
 a concern. This article walks you through the procedures of setting 
 up git repositories for which your local working directories are as 
 normal (un-encrypted) but the committed content is encrypted.
